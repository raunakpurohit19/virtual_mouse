# Virtual Mouse 🖱️🤖

This project implements a **Virtual Mouse** using computer vision techniques. It allows users to control mouse actions (like cursor movement and clicks) through hand gestures detected via a webcam, eliminating the need for physical devices.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Hand Gesture Detection**:
  - Control the cursor using hand movements.
  - Perform clicks, drags, and other mouse actions with specific gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**:
  - Fast and responsive hand tracking using advanced computer vision algorithms.
- **Touch-Free Operation**:
  - Ideal for scenarios requiring contactless interactions.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- A webcam for gesture detection.
- OpenCV and other Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raunakpurohit19/virtual_mouse.git
   cd virtual_mouse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure your webcam is functional and connected to your system.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the virtual mouse:
   ```bash
   python virtual_mouse.py
   ```

2. **Control the Mouse**:
   - Move your hand in front of the webcam to control the cursor.
   - Use predefined gestures for clicking, dragging, or other actions.

3. **Customize Gestures** (optional):
   Modify the script to add or change gesture mappings as per your preference.

## 📊 Demonstration
Here’s how the Virtual Mouse works:
- **Cursor Movement**: Move your hand to navigate the screen.
- **Left Click**: Make a pinching gesture with your thumb and index finger.
- **Right Click**: Use a different gesture (configured in the script).
